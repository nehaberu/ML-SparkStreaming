# ML-SparkStreaming
using Enron Email Spam Detection dataset
The aim is to perform machine learning tasks on large data streams.
-using Naïve Bayes Classifier and Linear SVM.
-Naïve Bayes Classifier is a probabilistic classifier, which means it predicts on basis of 
probability of an object.
-Using Apache Spark for streaming.
